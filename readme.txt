I have never been skiing.
None.
I used manhattan distance.
UCS was the slowest, BFS was the next slowest, A cost and greedy were about the same. I believe the uics was the slowest due to the fact that path cost was determined by the number on the tile which meant that ordering by path cost slowed the algorithm down. A star and greedy were about the same but A star usually found a shorter path than greedy.
